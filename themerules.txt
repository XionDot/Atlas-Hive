no i mean the black theme is gone, whatever you did made it go back to dark mode. okay so there is 1 standard default theme (that is the one used by macos system and it should follow that) then there are 2 custom themes, light ( just a light mode, but if the macos system is in dark mode the MENU BAR ICON should stay in dark mode and not change), then theres black mode (dark mode, should be as it was before you just made this change) also the menu bar is always black in macos so the menu icon shouldnt even change colour at all. The theme when first launched should be in system default. but when changed should save that theme state and use that on relaunch. for example user downloads app, system default theme is used, then they change to light and relaunch app then thheme should now be light for everythng until its changed. same will go if the user decides to select dark (black)
