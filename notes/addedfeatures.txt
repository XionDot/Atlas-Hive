3. Polish & UX Improvements ⚠️ (Partially done)
✅ Animated transitions between modes (already working with SwiftUI)
❌ Empty states for filters with no results
❌ Better error handling and user feedback
❌ Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+W to close, Cmd+R to refresh, etc.)
❌ Accessibility labels and VoiceOver support

💡 Graph time range options - 30s/60s/5min views
💡 Disk space warnings - Alert when running low
💡 Network bandwidth limits - Track daily/monthly usage
💡 CPU temperature monitoring - If supported by hardware
💡 Battery cycle tracking - Historical battery health data
