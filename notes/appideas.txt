I want a standalone app, it should have one 1 page the system monitor in a column but with a very nice layout and aesthetic so no scrolling is needed. on the other side should have the task manager, I want a simple and advanced mode like the menu bar widget. When closed the menu bar will stay open for the user. they can change this setting in the settings area. The user should have the option to auto open at start up. Any other features and ideas you can think of please suggest.
